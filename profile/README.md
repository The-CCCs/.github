## Hi there, we're The CCCs! 👋


🙋‍♀️ We are a group of people interested in programming with a variety of skills and experiences all working together to improve our abilities.

🌈 Wether it's to get a better job, a first job in the field, or just another skill to have in the pocket.

👩‍💻 We're currently located all over the US with different working schedules, but we still manage to get together from time to time.

🍿 Coding is about having fun and we sure do like fun! We have coding jams every so often with interesting themes.

🧙 There is always room to grow and we're always striving to learn something new.
